Produced by Tuff Contender, this song highlights a different part of love often overlooked by the usual chaos of a breakup or falling out: the pain of the inevitable fading of love. Gray uses thematic video choices, a strong central metaphor, and unique instruments to highlight themes of quiet heartbreak and distance, creating a turning point in romantic pop music and the struggles of relationships and how they are perceived in the digital age.¬†</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official music video for ‚ÄúAstronomy‚Äù is filmed in a personalized way that emphasizes the personal connection between two people. The filming being in first person, as if one was watching it through their own eyes, was a powerful artistic choice as this can automatically make the audience feel like they are experiencing this story as well. The video begins with Gray and his love interest in a warm-colored room, evoking intimacy and closeness, similar to the warmth of love and happiness felt in the peak of a relationship. The short clips of Gray and this person going through nature, climbing rocks, going on drives, give a carefree and nostalgic theme to this relationship. However, as the video progresses, the growing distance between the characters is subtly communicated through small body language and a lack of eye contact, mirroring the inevitable emotional drift that Gray highlights in his lyrics. The scenes can be seen as raw and real, which Gray does an amazing job with by matching the carefree lyrics with the music video.¬†</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rawness in this song highlights the social impact of Gray‚Äôs music. Before Conan Gray became a famous pop star, songs idealized the idea of love, leaving high expectations for romance. Giving a misguided impression, ‚Äúlove songs are a bit superficial in their treatment of certain aspects of its subject‚Äù (Teachout, 2015). This misrepresentation causes an. Gray, in addition to other up-and-coming artists of his time, leaned into a more raw and real side of love, not often spotlighted. The lyrics of ‚ÄúWe drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch, we joked as we looked that they were too good for us‚Äù open the song to the realistic life of middle-class teens experiencing life and love for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most striking elements of the video is its use of space and movement. As the couple walks, they gradually drift apart while the camera tilts, creating a dreamlike, mystical effect. This visual metaphor reinforces the song‚Äôs theme of how love can drift apart slowly, imperceptibly at first, until the distance is too large to bridge. Gray paired this with the audio of ‚Äúelectronic swells, sounding like a spaceship beeping or a star shooting in the sky‚Äù (Erhlich, 2021) behind his lyrics. The video and audio capture the slow unraveling and shift from intimacy to isolation. This heightens the pain, as neither the characters nor possibly the viewers fully grasp what‚Äôs happening until it's too late.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song‚Äôs instrumental arrangement is restrained, creating a dreamlike, almost weightless feeling. The soft acoustic guitar, reverb, and gentle vocal delivery highlight the emotional distance described in the lyrics. Unlike many contemporary pop ballads that rely on major climaxes, ‚ÄúAstronomy‚Äù deliberately restrains itself, avoiding the urge to swell into dramatic instrumentation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray‚Äôs vocal performance, delicate yet full of emotion, conveys a sense of nostalgia with the way he delivers lines such as "You said it‚Äôs not that hard, but we were miles apart in different stars" feels like a whisper into nothingness, like space. This demonstrates how love, no matter how strong, cannot defy the laws of time and change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song's main metaphor of ‚Äúastronomy‚Äù creates vivid imagery that can help the audience understand the lyrics' meaning. Stars and planets naturally drift together and apart, moving in ways beyond anyone‚Äôs control. In the same way, people can grow distant without either being at fault. Space, vast and mysterious, mirrors the uncertainty of love, both are understood only in fragments, revealed over time. Gray captures this uncertainty in the lyric ‚ÄúStop trying to keep us alive / You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died‚Äù. The song shifts here, intensifying as his vocals rise, echoing the realization that relationships, like stars, can die before anyone notices.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This theme deeply resonates with listeners in the digital generation. With social media and technology, staying in contact with people globally has become easier. However, this makes it harder to maintain genuine intimacy, as it creates an illusion of closeness. This generation is accustomed to the complexities of online relationships, long-distance love, and the slow erosion of bonds that once felt unbreakable. "Astronomy" captures a modern dilemma, the illusion that a relationship is still alive simply because it hasn‚Äôt ended outright. Even when the emotional connection has faded, the absence of a break can create the false comfort that everything is fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAstronomy‚Äù highlights the often unspoken conclusion of many relationships with different uses of wording and visual appearance. It also marked a shift in modern pop music by destroying the idealized version of love and representing the authentic relationship challenges that can happen. Conan Gray‚Äôs "Astronomy" reflects the struggles of a generation shaped by technology, where meaningful connections are rarer, and digital relationships create new obstacles to intimacy.</span></p><p>More on figurative language<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1vtH2MmsmjfN7BsQZSgzXu?si=455230a033674a0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Here</a></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html">üåï</a></p><p>¬†</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
