Then, when you have finished your travels, click the "Astronomy" button at the top again to fully understand the music with your new knowledge</p><p>On May 7th, 2021, Conan Gray released the official music video of Astronomy, a song that gained over 13 million views within 3 years. Produced by Tuff Contender, this song highlights a different part of love often overlooked by the usual chaos of a breakup or falling out: the pain of the inevitable fading of love. Gray uses thematic video choices, a strong central metaphor, and unique instruments to highlight themes of quiet heartbreak and distance, creating a turning point in romantic pop music and the struggles of relationships and how they are perceived in the digital age.<br><br>The official music video for Astronomy is filmed in a personalized way that emphasizes the personal connection between two people. The first-person perspective is a powerful artistic choice, making the audience feel as if they are experiencing the story themselves. The video begins with Gray and his love interest in a warm-colored room, evoking intimacy and closeness, like the warmth of love at its peak. Short clips of Gray and his partner climbing rocks and going on drives create a nostalgic tone. As the video progresses, the growing emotional distance is shown through subtle body language and lack of eye contact, mirroring the emotional drift highlighted in the lyrics. The scenes feel raw and authentic, matching the gentle delivery of the lyrics and adding to the emotional power of the piece.<br><br>This authenticity contributes to the broader cultural shift in pop music. Prior to artists like Conan Gray, pop songs often idealized love, promoting unattainable romantic standards. As Teachout (2015) notes, ‚Äúlove songs are a bit superficial in their treatment of certain aspects of its subject.‚Äù In contrast, Gray embraces the uncomfortable reality that not all relationships end in drama, some simply fade. The lyric ‚ÄúWe drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch, we joked as we looked that they were too good for us‚Äù captures this shift. It's not glamorous, but it‚Äôs real. Gray‚Äôs work reflects a growing movement among young pop artists to challenge shallow love tropes by turning toward emotional authenticity.<br><br>One of the most striking elements of the video is its use of space and movement. As the couple walks, they drift apart while the camera tilts, creating a dreamlike, mystical effect. This visual metaphor supports the song‚Äôs central theme: that love doesn‚Äôt always explode, it sometimes disappears slowly, quietly. This message is heightened by the background sound effects, such as ‚Äúelectronic swells, sounding like a spaceship beeping or a star shooting in the sky‚Äù (Erhlich, 2021). These sci-fi textures tie directly into the astronomical metaphor, positioning the couple like celestial bodies drifting apart, echoing the lyric, ‚ÄúYou said it‚Äôs not that hard, but we were miles apart in different stars.‚Äù The comparison to stars, dying light-years away without our knowing, becomes a haunting metaphor for emotional disconnection.<br><br>The instrumental arrangement reinforces this sense of drifting. Gray avoids dramatic climaxes and keeps the composition restrained, soft acoustic guitar, reverb, and a delicate vocal delivery give the song a weightless, space-like atmosphere. His voice carries quiet emotion, especially in lines like ‚ÄúYou're pointing at stars in the sky that already died,‚Äù where his vocals rise slightly, echoing realization and grief. This central metaphor of astronomy serves not only as lyrical decoration but as the emotional core of the piece. It elevates the song from just another breakup ballad to a meditation on how time, space, and change affect love.<br><br>This metaphor also ties back to a key theme in my broader project: how emotional distance is often expressed through celestial imagery. Gray‚Äôs use of stars and space becomes a way to capture that slow, quiet unraveling. In my earlier writing, I explored how artists use metaphor to communicate emotional nuance. Here, Gray embodies that idea by likening growing apart to astronomical phenomena, uncontrollable, inevitable, and natural. By reinforcing this metaphor in both lyrics and visuals, Gray invites listeners to feel not just heartbreak but the quiet sadness of emotional drift.<br><br>The message resonates even more deeply in the digital era. Technology makes connection easier, but often only in surface-level ways. Real intimacy becomes harder to maintain, and Gray captures this tension. His lyrics reflect a modern dilemma: just because two people still talk, share photos, or like each other's posts doesn't mean the connection is alive. Astronomy reflects the confusion of staying in a relationship that looks fine on the outside but is already emotionally over.<br><br>In the end, Astronomy doesn‚Äôt just tell a story, it challenges our perception of love in modern pop. Gray doesn‚Äôt offer resolution or blame; instead, he shares a truth many experience but few express. This willingness to dwell in ambiguity marks a shift in pop music's emotional maturity. By capturing a type of heartbreak that is quiet, slow, and distant, Gray elevates pop songwriting, and brings it closer to poetry. His work shows that pop music, when crafted with care and metaphor, can serve not only as art but also as a powerful educational tool.</p><p>More on figurative language<a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/figurative-language-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Here</a></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html">üåï</a></p><p>¬†</p></div></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>¬© Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><div id="soundcloud-player-container" style="display:none;"><iframe id="soundcloud-iframe" width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1039577401&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></div><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/conan-gray" title="Conan Gray" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Conan Gray</a> ¬∑ <a href="https://soundcloud.com/conan-gray/astronomy" title="Astronomy" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Astronomy</a></div><script src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/api.js"></script><script>// Check if the page has loaded, then show the SoundCloud player and restore playback position
