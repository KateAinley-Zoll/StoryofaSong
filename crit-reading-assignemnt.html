Released in 2022 under Republic Records, "Astronomy" captures the slow and painful process of emotional distance, a theme that feels especially relevant today. Through a galaxy metaphor, Gray shows that love isn’t always perfect and that relationships don’t always fall apart in big, dramatic moments but instead fade over time such like how stars often die off but we never know until years later. The figurative language in the song helps create an emotional response, making it really impactful (Ardike, 205). While the song is about growing apart, it also reflects how love and connection are affected by technology, which can bring people together but also make them feel more alone. Instead of following the typical love story found in most pop songs, "Astronomy" offers a more realistic perspective on relationships and how they change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my Critical Analysis of Distance in Love, I analyzed how the lyrics and sound of "Astronomy" emphasize themes of emotional distance. Unlike most pop songs that focus on either falling in love or dramatic breakups, Astronomy is about the in-between, the quiet pain of drifting apart. The music video starts with warm tones and soft lighting, showing intimacy, but as the song progresses, the colors get cooler, and Gray and his love interest become physically farther apart, representing emotional detachment. Gray expresses raw emotions, which is unique since men in pop music are often pressured to fit traditional masculine norms (Hansen, 2022). These elements show how modern relationships can be complicated, especially with technology playing such a big role. The podcast </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thoughtline: On Love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discusses how "love has changed over time and how today’s relationships don’t fit the same idealized expectations from the past". This connects to how Gray’s music reflects a more relatable view of love. His soft, dreamlike vocals and simple instrumentals make the song feel even more heartbreaking. Instead of a dramatic chorus, Astronomy is subtle, which makes it feel even more real. This is part of why the song stands out, it moves away from the typical romanticized love stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my paper on How Metaphors Affect Writing, I wrote about how Gray’s figurative language is a powerful “communication tool,” as described by Wynne May Ardike, Dyah Nugrahani, and Nur Hidayat. Their research explains how lyrics can enhance storytelling and connect to poetry education. The analysis focused on how "Astronomy" uses metaphors to show a dead relationship. Metaphors are common in songwriting because they help highlight deeper meanings through connections in the audience's mind (Faristian, 2021). Gray’s use of celestial imagery makes the song feel even more emotional because it suggests that growing apart is as inevitable as planets drifting away. This connects to my argument that his songwriting is poetic and emotionally powerful. By comparing "Astronomy" to other works discussed, Gray’s lyrics fit into a larger conversation about how music uses figurative language to express complex emotions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my Playlist &amp; Listening Guide, I created a playlist that explores how relationships change with distance, similar to the five stages of grief. The songs represent different phases of emotional separation, starting with idealization and unrealistic expectations, then moving through self-doubt, realization, denial, nostalgia, and, finally, acceptance. Each song connects to "Astronomy" through its lyrics, sound, or overall emotion. Some of the songs use space-related imagery, while others focus on the feeling of losing someone emotionally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with James Arthur’s “Falling Like the Stars”, representing the early stage of love when it feels endless and perfect. As doubt creeps in, Taylor Swift’s “The Archer” reflects insecurity and foreshadows emotional distance. Denial is captured in Gracie Abrams’ “I Miss You, I’m Sorry,” where the narrator struggles to accept that the relationship is fading. Nostalgia builds in Lorde’s “Supercut”, where memories of perfect moments make it harder to face reality. Olivia Rodrigo’s “Stranger” represents the moment when love feels unrecognizable—someone once close now feels like a stranger. The loneliness deepens with Cavetown’s “Meteor Shower”, where cosmic imagery symbolizes love slipping away. Finally, “Astronomy” closes the playlist, representing acceptance, acknowledging that love, like the stars, eventually drifts apart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, these songs tell a story about how relationships shift over time, moving from hope and excitement to doubt, longing, and finally, acceptance. The celestial imagery ties everything together, just like stars shine brightly before fading, love can feel infinite at first, but eventually becomes distant. Through each of these essays, Astronomy fits into a bigger emotional journey that many people can relate to, whether in romantic relationships or friendships.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html">🌕</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
