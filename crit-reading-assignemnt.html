Released in 2022 under Republic Records, "Astronomy" captures the slow and painful process of emotional distance, a theme that feels especially relevant today. Through a galaxy metaphor, Gray shows that love isn’t always perfect and that relationships don’t always fall apart in big, dramatic moments but instead fade over time, just like how stars often die off unnoticed. The figurative language in the song helps create an emotional response, making it really impactful (Ardike 2025, 205, et al.). While the song is about growing apart, it also reflects how love and connection are affected by technology, which can bring people together but also make them feel more alone. Social media is often seen as an outlet of jealously for partners (Vogel 2020, et al.) as it opens the opportunity for partners to connect with others and decreasing their physical interactions, causing distance. Instead of following the typical love story found in most pop songs, "Astronomy" offers a more realistic perspective on relationships and how they change. Gray’s portrayal of emotional distance not only reflects personal experiences but also challenges cultural expectations that love should always be dramatic or ideal, encouraging listeners to rethink how love is represented in the modern world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on this theme of emotional distance, the lyrics and sound of "Astronomy" emphasize subtle disconnection with various cosmic themes and unique diction. As you travel through the song's universe, you will realize that, unlike most pop songs that focus on either falling in love or dramatic breakups, "Astronomy" is about the in-between, the quiet pain of drifting apart. The music video starts with warm tones and soft lighting, showing intimacy, but as the song progresses, the colors get cooler, and Gray and his love interest become physically farther apart, representing emotional detachment. Gray expresses raw emotions, which is unique since men in pop music are often pressured to fit traditional masculine norms (Hansen 2022). These elements show how modern relationships can be complicated, especially with technology playing such a big role. The podcast Throughline: On Love, which features interviews with relationship experts and sociologists, discusses how "love has changed over time and how today’s relationships don’t fit the same idealized expectations from the past" (Arablouei 2024, et al.). This connects to how Gray’s music reflects a more relatable view of love. His soft, dreamlike vocals and simple instrumentals make the song feel even more heartbreaking. Instead of a dramatic chorus, "Astronomy" is subtle, which makes it feel even more real. This is part of why the song stands out, it moves away from the typical romanticized love stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To explore Gray’s lyrical style further, you will then travel to how his figurative language is a powerful “communication tool,” as described by Wynne May Ardike, Dyah Nugrahani, and Nur Hidayat in The Power of Metaphor in Music. Their research, published in an academic journal, explains how lyrics can enhance storytelling and connect to poetry education. I focused on how "Astronomy" uses metaphors to show a dead relationship. Metaphors are common in songwriting because they help highlight deeper meanings through connections in the audience's mind (Faristian, 2021, et al.). Gray’s use of celestial imagery makes the song feel even more emotional because it suggests that growing apart is as inevitable as planets drifting away.  The language Gray uses contruct power dynamics and emotional boundaries rather than simply expressing internal states, like broad feelings. (Angel 2025, et al.). Rather, he uses rhetorical devices to make his message resonate deeper with his audience his songwriting more poetic and emotionally powerful. By comparing "Astronomy" to other works discussed, Gray’s lyrics fit into a larger conversation about how music uses figurative language to express complex emotions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To expand on these ideas, a playlist that explores how relationships change with distance, similar to the five stages of grief, will come to your horizon in "Astronomy's neighboring planets”. The songs represent different phases of emotional separation, starting with idealization and unrealistic expectations, then moving through self-doubt, realization, denial, nostalgia, and, finally, acceptance. Each song connects to "Astronomy" through its lyrics, sound, or overall emotion. Connecting to the cultural significance of Gray's music, he often puts in undertones of not fitting in.  Lustig Hanna (2020) discussed the racial criticising Gray gathered from the use of a single emoji, this criticisim is  highlighted in his songs such as in his lyrics "cause socially speaking we were the same", underscoring that he and the second character were different in every other aspect. This helps resonates with the audience who may have also felt the same isolation due to cultural or social reasons. Some of the songs use space-related imagery, while others focus on the feeling of losing someone emotionally to express these ideas.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It starts with James Arthur’s “Falling Like the Stars”, representing the early stage of love when it feels endless and perfect. As doubt creeps in, Taylor Swift’s “The Archer” reflects insecurity and foreshadows emotional distance. Denial is captured in Gracie Abrams’ “I Miss You, I’m Sorry,” where the narrator struggles to accept that the relationship is fading. Nostalgia builds in Lorde’s “Supercut”, where memories of perfect moments make it harder to face reality. Olivia Rodrigo’s “Stranger” represents the moment when love feels unrecognizable, someone once close now feels like a stranger. The loneliness deepens with Cavetown’s “Meteor Shower”, where cosmic imagery symbolizes love slipping away. Finally, "Astronomy" closes the playlist, representing acceptance, acknowledging that love, like the stars, eventually drifts apart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, these songs tell a story about how relationships shift over time, moving from hope and excitement to doubt, longing, and finally, acceptance. The celestial imagery ties everything together, just like stars shine brightly before fading, love can feel infinite at first, but eventually becomes distant. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you will travel to the end, the "Exploding Star", where the idea of a broader interpretation is explored. This song, although automatically can be seen as a romantic song. Gray keeps the wording quite broad, so it could also be interpreted as a loving friendship. Platonic distance can happen emotionally or geographically. Such as two friends going to college across the country, the distance in their relationship can grow without realization as two people grow in different environments. Through each of these reflections, "Astronomy" fits into a bigger emotional journey that many people can relate to, whether in romantic relationships or friendships. Altogether, these works reveal a shift in musical storytelling, one that leans into emotional ambiguity rather than resolution, offering a deeper, more authentic reflection of how relationships evolve in a digital and emotionally complex world. "Astronomy" pushes listeners to recognize that love isn’t always fiery or dramatic; sometimes, it simply fades. This perspective challenges the dominant narrative in pop culture, making space for more nuanced, honest stories. By exploring emotional distance through the metaphor of a galaxy, vast, beautiful, and lonely, this project encourages readers to reflect on their own connections, losses, and the slow, quiet moments that define real relationships.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><br><br></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html">🌕</a></p></div></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>© Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
