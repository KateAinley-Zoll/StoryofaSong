Released in 2022 under Republic Records, "Astronomy" captures the slow and painful process of emotional distance, a theme that feels especially relevant today. Through a galaxy metaphor, Gray shows that love isn‚Äôt always perfect and that relationships don‚Äôt always fall apart in big, dramatic moments but instead fade over time, just like how stars often die off unnoticed. The figurative language in the song helps create an emotional response, making it really impactful (Ardike, 205). While the song is about growing apart, it also reflects how love and connection are affected by technology, which can bring people together but also make them feel more alone. Instead of following the typical love story found in most pop songs, "Astronomy" offers a more realistic perspective on relationships and how they change. Gray‚Äôs portrayal of emotional distance not only reflects personal experiences but also challenges cultural expectations that love should always be dramatic or ideal, encouraging listeners to rethink how love is represented in the modern world.<br><br>Building on this theme of emotional distance, I analyzed how the lyrics and sound of "Astronomy" emphasize subtle disconnection. Unlike most pop songs that focus on either falling in love or dramatic breakups, "Astronomy" is about the in-between, the quiet pain of drifting apart. The music video starts with warm tones and soft lighting, showing intimacy, but as the song progresses, the colors get cooler, and Gray and his love interest become physically farther apart, representing emotional detachment. Gray expresses raw emotions, which is unique since men in pop music are often pressured to fit traditional masculine norms (Hansen, 2022). These elements show how modern relationships can be complicated, especially with technology playing such a big role. The podcast Thoughtline: On Love, which features interviews with relationship experts and sociologists, discusses how "love has changed over time and how today‚Äôs relationships don‚Äôt fit the same idealized expectations from the past." This connects to how Gray‚Äôs music reflects a more relatable view of love. His soft, dreamlike vocals and simple instrumentals make the song feel even more heartbreaking. Instead of a dramatic chorus, "Astronomy" is subtle, which makes it feel even more real. This is part of why the song stands out, it moves away from the typical romanticized love stories.<br><br>To explore Gray‚Äôs lyrical style further, I wrote about how his figurative language is a powerful ‚Äúcommunication tool,‚Äù as described by Wynne May Ardike, Dyah Nugrahani, and Nur Hidayat in The Power of Metaphor in Music. Their research, published in an academic journal, explains how lyrics can enhance storytelling and connect to poetry education. I focused on how "Astronomy" uses metaphors to show a dead relationship. Metaphors are common in songwriting because they help highlight deeper meanings through connections in the audience's mind (Faristian, 2021). Gray‚Äôs use of celestial imagery makes the song feel even more emotional because it suggests that growing apart is as inevitable as planets drifting away. This connects to my argument that his songwriting is poetic and emotionally powerful. By comparing "Astronomy" to other works discussed, Gray‚Äôs lyrics fit into a larger conversation about how music uses figurative language to express complex emotions.<br><br>To expand on these ideas, I created a playlist that explores how relationships change with distance, similar to the five stages of grief. The songs represent different phases of emotional separation, starting with idealization and unrealistic expectations, then moving through self-doubt, realization, denial, nostalgia, and, finally, acceptance. Each song connects to "Astronomy" through its lyrics, sound, or overall emotion. Some of the songs use space-related imagery, while others focus on the feeling of losing someone emotionally.<br><br>It starts with James Arthur‚Äôs ‚ÄúFalling Like the Stars‚Äù, representing the early stage of love when it feels endless and perfect. As doubt creeps in, Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Archer‚Äù reflects insecurity and foreshadows emotional distance. Denial is captured in Gracie Abrams‚Äô ‚ÄúI Miss You, I‚Äôm Sorry,‚Äù where the narrator struggles to accept that the relationship is fading. Nostalgia builds in Lorde‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupercut‚Äù, where memories of perfect moments make it harder to face reality. Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs ‚ÄúStranger‚Äù represents the moment when love feels unrecognizable, someone once close now feels like a stranger. The loneliness deepens with Cavetown‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeteor Shower‚Äù, where cosmic imagery symbolizes love slipping away. Finally, "Astronomy" closes the playlist, representing acceptance, acknowledging that love, like the stars, eventually drifts apart.<br><br>Together, these songs tell a story about how relationships shift over time, moving from hope and excitement to doubt, longing, and finally, acceptance. The celestial imagery ties everything together, just like stars shine brightly before fading, love can feel infinite at first but eventually becomes distant. Through each of these reflections, "Astronomy" fits into a bigger emotional journey that many people can relate to, whether in romantic relationships or friendships. Altogether, these works reveal a shift in musical storytelling, one that leans into emotional ambiguity rather than resolution, offering a deeper, more authentic reflection of how relationships evolve in a digital and emotionally complex world.<br><br><br><br></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html">üåï</a></p></div></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>¬© Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
