But what happens when love fades, not automatically, but over time? Astronomy by Conan Gray explores this by using a cosmic metaphor to create imagery and illustrate emotional distance between two people. This playlist creates a story of a relationship, and how the idealization of love slowly fades as time goes on and through the experience of love itself. They break the illusion of love's perfection and instead show the rawness, fragile and complicated part of relationships that are often overlooked by artists through dramatic love confessions and chaotic breakups. In contrast, these songs highlight the quieter pain of emotional distance, the soft demise of feelings that once felt unbreakable, and the slow realization that perfection was never truly attainable. Each track builds on the idea that love often leaves one person still reaching for something that is slowly slipping away. As the playlist progresses, the songs create a tension between the yearning for something that once felt endless and the slow awareness that love, like the stars themselves, is often fleeting. The cosmic imagery continues to resonate, but now, it’s filled with a quiet sadness, reflecting the emotional journey of understanding love’s short-lived ness. Themes of realization and acknowledgement of the denied bridge slowly grow in this playlist just as a human would when they figure out what had happened. It's a reflection on how idealization and reality collide, leaving us with the bittersweet realization that love, no matter how destined, is ultimately fragile and imperfect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With romcoms and love stories shared through music and books, love is often seen as an unrealistic concept, twisted by societal standards to be what we “want it” to be. But perfection is impossible, especially in a relationship, yet many people end up learning this the hard way. In “Falling like the Stars”, the artist, James Arthur, uses the same metaphors as “Astronomy”  but idealizes love with caution. Arthur does idealize love with his star metaphor, saying that he and a love interest are falling in love like “falling stars”.  The love in this song is an all-consuming, unwavering force with heartfelt lyrics and depicting a love destined in time.  Using hyperboles to describe his love, such as “I’ll never let go” and the cosmic metaphor of stars, it shows how he feels his love to be unshakeable.  Falling stars being meteorite pieces waiting to burn up in the atmosphere, emphasizes the dramatized love Arthur sings of, saying that the love is so big it may kill them. This song is a contrast to Gray’s song, highlighting the slow disillusionment even more. To Arthur, everything is perfect and he even sings about the future with this love interest, planning their days together with children and a house. This idealization creates standards of love for the audience listening. If they have not experienced love themselves, this may be the only exposure they have, and this creates an idea that is simply not true. This conflicting idea of love juxtaposes “Astronomy”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly, highlighting the painful moment when promises (such as never letting go) begin to fade, underscoring the divide between romantic idealism and reality. Although love can feel infinite and perfect, there sometimes comes a time where that feeling fades and just disappears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before distance is created, doubt is introduced into the relationship. Taylor Swift's song “The Archer” highlights this in a relationship with a metaphor of an archer, someone who is both a fighter and a target. Both “Astronomy” and “The Archer” use overall metaphors in their songs to describe the difficulties in relationships that are often overlooked. With Swift stating “I’ve been the archer, I’ve been the prey”, it shows her struggle with self-doubt and how she both attacks herself and feels vulnerable to others. Doubts in relationships are very common, but not as common in music. This aligns with “Astronomy” by Conan Gray who describes the love fading through cosmic metaphors such as “We connected like constellations” and “We can't keep holding onto nothing” showing how distance grows between people regardless of how intertwined they had felt before. Both these songs use an internal perspective as well as an echoing synth, which heightens the feeling of isolation, a major theme in both distance and doubt. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment that a bridge is realized, it's shocking and devastating. Gracie Abrams explores this idea in “I Miss You, I’m Sorry”. Abrams reflects on her emotions towards realizing that her once “perfect relationship” had concluded. In her lyrics, she realizes that she had idealized love and that idea had broken her more, after she realized that the idealization was unrealistic. In her chorus she states “You said ‘forever’ and I almost bought it”, an idea reflected in the first song about how promises often lead to disappointment when in an idealized mindset. This is a direct contrast to “Falling like the stars” where he stated “I’ll never let you go”. It's almost as if Abrams is responding to Arthur, directly emphasizing how promises create unrealistic expectations. Abrams' confessional style gives a rawness to this song, similar to “Astronomy”. Her diary-like quality underscores the difficulty of letting go, with whispered and echoed vocals along with gentle instruments creating an atmosphere of quiet devastation, much like what distance brings. Abrams stated “I gave you the world, but you just wanted space” which highlighted the experience of love slipping away with no way of helping it. Like “Astronomy”, this lyric emphasizes the heartbreak of watching love dissolve, even when there's a desire to hold on. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This heartbreak takes time to overcome because, unlike a chaotic breakup, with distance, it's harder to find closure. There is constant self-blame and grasping for solutions by racking your mind with the memories of what went wrong and trying to deny the distance. In “Supercut” by Lorde, this exact idea is described in lyrics and musical devices. Lordes' fast-paced and urgent delivery contrasts with the softness of “Astronomy” yet both songs revolve around the replaying of memories, the longing of something that no longer exists. “In my head, I do everything right”, highlights how people tend to replay only the best moments of love, ignoring the imperfections. This song is driven by the sense of a longing for an idealized version of love that never fully existed. “Supercut” reflects on how movies, books and pop culture shape our perception of love. With a “supercut” being exciting, fast-paced and full of grand gestures, it often ignored the more normal or painful parts of a real relationship. Unlike “Supercut”, which remains trapped in an illusion, “Astronomy” highlights the acceptance of faded love. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olivia Rodrigo’s song “Stranger” continues the theme of watching love change into something unfamiliar. Her raw vocal delivery and sharp lyrics reflect the emotional weight of realizing someone you once knew had become a stranger. While “Astronomy” described the slow inevitable drifting of two people, “Stranger” highlights the disorienting and confusing feeling of looking at someone you once loved and realizing they felt like a stranger. Both songs emphasize how love can feel infinite and irreplaceable at one moment, only to be nothing over time. “Stranger” conveys a sense of loss, similar to Gray’s song, but not just a sense of loss in a relationship, but of a deep emotional connection that once existed. By stating “it's like we never loved at all”, she shows her disbelief at how easily someone she loved could become a stranger, underscoring how idealization of love was false and took her by surprise when this happened. Rodrigo showed the reality that love doesn't last forever, no matter how passionate or perfect the relationship is at that time, it does not guarantee permanence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the realization and doubt of the growing distance, sadness overflows one's mind. In “Meteor Shower” by Cavetown, the lyrics describe a meteor shower, a metaphor for intense love, and how it had ended. The narrator of the song is left in loneliness and longing. The idea that something so beautiful and looked up to, such as a meteor shower, disappears so quickly, can emphasize how transient love can be. The underlying sadness and isolation in the music is seen by the vocals of just one artist. The tone of the voice seems to be in a “monotone” type singing in many parts of the song, highlighting the isolation of the singer/lover. The delicate acoustic audio provides a moment of stillness, with the cosmic sounds in the track, again continuing the idea of astronomy. The lyrics “But when I’m alone, it's like I’m in space.”, invoking a feeling of emptiness, an emotion often following a breakup or lost connection. The narrator feels disconnected, despite the intensity of their feelings when the love was present, which is not anymore.  Both “Meteor Shower” and “Astronomy” use these cosmic metaphors to explore the complexities of love, but they approach it from different angles, with Cavetown celebrating the magical idealized qualities, slowly turning into sadness, while Gray focuses on the acceptance and inevitable fade of love. Together, these songs emphasize the fragility of love.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step of this, acceptance. "Astronomy” by Conan Gray, the foundation of this playlist is the final piece of emotional distance in relationships. The song’s themes of nostalgia and distance, using the vastness of space and stars as a metaphor for emotional detachment, emphasizes the rawness of love and how the idealization is unrealistic for romance.  The acceptance is seen through his lyrics such as “I guess I should’ve seen it coming, But I couldn't see beyond your smile”.  This line directly speaks to the realization that despite his understanding that he idealized love, the reality of their disconnection was there all along, hidden behind the illusion of a perfect relationship. The melancholy instrumentation creates a sense of quiet resignation, reinforcing the emotional distance that Gray is coming to terms with. The lyrics "I thought I'd see you in the stars,  but you’re just like the ones I see in the sky" show how Gray’s dreams of a celestial love slowly dissolve, as he realizes that the love he once thought would be forever is as distant as the stars themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playlist tells the story of idealized love through the lens of cosmic imagery and a relationship's steps, gradually breaking down the illusion and confronting the raw, messy reality of relationships. Each track builds on the last, moving from the dream-like expectations of love in “Falling Like the Stars”  to the heartbreaking realization in "Stranger " that love is not always as it seems and finally acceptance in “Astronomy”. By the end,  these songs together become less about the fantasy of love and more about its human fragility. From the yearning echoes of many of these songs to the tender acceptance of “Astronomy”, this playlist navigates the evolution of love from the celestial to the grounded, emphasizing the realization that love is, possibly, never truly written in the stars.</span></p><p> </p><p>Listen to more <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1vtH2MmsmjfN7BsQZSgzXu?si=455230a033674a0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
