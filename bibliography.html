Jordan sat cross-legged on the cold floor of her freshman dorm, surrounded by half-packed suitcases and the hollow quiet of a nearly empty building. Her roommate had left that morning, promising to keep in touch, and then the door clicked shut behind her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the room was stripped of its personality. No more fairy lights. No more concert posters, sticky notes, or scribbled reminders on the whiteboard. Just the outlines left behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months of her life, packed away in Target bags and plastic bins. Crumpled papers from lectures she barely remembered, wristbands from dorm parties she probably should’ve skipped, a tangled string of bracelets someone had braided onto her wrist during orientation week. Every item, a version of herself, one already growing distant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened the “misc” box without really looking, her fingers brushing past a chipped mug, a dried-out lip balm, and a photo strip from her first week. She barely remembered taking it, her hair was different, and her smile a little more naive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, there it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wrinkled envelope, yellowed around the edges, sealed with a crooked piece of washi tape. The name Jordan was written across the front in loopy, uneven handwriting she knew better than her own.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riley.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her heart did that annoying twisty thing before she could stop it. She hadn’t thought about Riley, not deeply anyway, in months. Not in a real way. Not in the way that made your chest feel too small for your ribs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weight of the letter sat in her lap for a moment. Her fingers hesitated on the flap. Her thumb traced the edge. It felt like touching a bruise. She opened it anyway.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Jordan,</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You're going to College!!! I am so proud of you for getting into your dream college and even though it's across the country from me (rude), I know you will fit in great with all the smart people there. I'm gonna miss you so much, we have been with each other since 3rd grade and even though I’m taking a gap year and can't follow you to Boston, I know we will text and call every day you're gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love you forever,</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ri Ri</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They really had talked every day, at first. FaceTime while Jordan walked back from class. Long voice notes. Endless memes. They’d narrate their days like a shared diary. Riley’s gap year was chaotic but charming including art classes, cat-sitting gigs, and spontaneous day trips. She dyed her hair purple and got a matching tattoo with someone Jordan had never even heard of. She was alive in a way Jordan couldn’t afford to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan was buried in lab reports and extracurriculars, networking mixers, and back-to-back lectures. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to talk, she just…didn’t have room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calls became shorter, with less laughter and fewer details. Riley would talk about their old group, the people Jordan had left behind, still going to bonfires, still hanging out in the same diner. Jordan smiled and nodded, but her world now was full of new names, new ideas, and people who spoke in future tense sentences. People who saw the world the way she did. Riley didn’t, not anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Thanksgiving, the conversations were dry. Stilted. Polite. By March, they had nothing left to say. They didn’t fight. There were no accusations. Just missed calls. Messages left on “read.” A silence that crept in so slowly it felt natural.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And maybe that was what hurt the most, how natural it all felt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That summer, when they finally saw each other again, Jordan felt something hollow ring through her. She wanted to believe it would all come rushing back — the rhythm, the ease, the magic. It didn’t.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They met at their favorite café, the one with the sticky tabletops and the string lights in the windows. It used to feel like a second home. Now it felt too bright. Too loud. Riley was the same, in so many ways — that warm laugh, that lopsided smile. But her stories were unfamiliar now. She talked about a road trip to Oregon with people Jordan had never met. A zine she was working on. Her dreams of maybe living in a van. She still didn’t have a five-year plan, or even a five-month one. And Jordan? Jordan had already applied for research assistantships. She had color-coded her LSAT prep. Her future was spreadsheets and resumes, interviews and deadlines. She had learned to speak a new language — one Riley didn’t understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point, Jordan made a joke about a podcast no one back home listened to. Riley laughed but didn’t get it. Then Riley talked about someone named Theo for five minutes before realizing Jordan had no idea who that was. They laughed anyway. Out of habit. They finished their drinks in silence. When it was time to go, they stood outside and hugged. Not too long. Not too short. Just enough to be kind. “Let’s hang out again soon,” Riley said, pulling away. Jordan nodded. “Yeah.” They both meant it and they both knew they wouldn’t.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That night, Jordan lay in her childhood bed, staring at the glow-in-the-dark stars still stuck to the ceiling. The same ones Riley had helped her hang during a sleepover in sixth grade. They used to lie there for hours, making up stories about each one,  naming them, mapping their made-up galaxies. She tried to remember the names, but she couldn’t. She thought about the way Riley used to say “We’re cosmic, you and me. Like, some stars just find each other.” She used to believe that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was no one's fault, they were both their own person, who were once the most important thing to each other, and maybe that was the saddest part. How nothing had gone wrong. And still, everything had gone quiet.</span></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflection–</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This narrative relates to my song “Astronomy” because I argue how the song is not only about romantic distance but can also be seen as distance within a friendship. Gray left the song's interpretation very broad and while most people immediately think of romance, I highlight with the narrative the distance being similar within a close-knit friendship. College is one of the biggest things that can cause distance between because geographically but also emotionally as people change and grow rapidly in a new environment. For two best friends being so far in different environments, it's very likely they grow into different people with different aspirations and just don't connect the way they used to, with it not being either of their faults. This is reflected in “Astronomy” since it talks about being “two worlds apart” such as different stages in life, different states, etc. This draft tries to capture the sadness but also the acceptance of the distance and how they grow in different directions but appreciate what they once had, just like in the song about two lovers. I also plan to put in more metaphors and figurative language to connect it more deeply with how Gray captured his audience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is different from my other papers because I spoke about the technology effect, but for this, I wanted to highlight Gray's broad audience and how he can reach and touch the hearts of so many people in the world with his music because his message applies to many whether romantically or platonically with his metaphors and use of figurative language being so open to interpretation. The song and album it's in, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superache</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “has also garnered significant attention on various platforms, including TikTok. With frequent appearances on TikTok, listeners familiar with the music may become more intrigued by the meanings of the lyrics and feel a deeper connection to the songs” (Ardike, 206). His wide audience shows his impact on the world with the messages in which he tries to convey combined with the open interpretation shows his overall significance to the music industry.</span></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
