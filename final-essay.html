The article argues that figurative language in music can ‚Äúevoke emotional responses from their audiences‚Äù and are ‚Äúpowerful communication tools‚Äù (205), which is why Gray‚Äôs songs resonate with a wide audience. This is particularly relevant in educational settings, where students can better understand poetry through modern music. Gray‚Äôs work, especially in <em data-start="1123" data-end="1134">Superache</em>, challenges traditional pop‚Äôs presentation of love as idealized by showing how emotional drift is just as central to romantic experience.</p><p data-start="1274" data-end="1942">The authors highlight metaphors as the dominant figurative language in the album, claiming they are the most effective in influencing audiences. They emphasize the similarity between poetry and Gray‚Äôs lyrics, noting that both use figurative devices to ‚Äúconvey explicit messages and enhance aesthetic appeal‚Äù (205). To support this claim, Ardike, Nugrahani, and Hidayat reference Geoffrey N. Leech‚Äôs <em data-start="1673" data-end="1711">A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry</em> (2014), which categorizes eight types of figurative language. They also compare Gray‚Äôs use of metaphor with other artists such as Panungkas, NIKI, and Maroon 5 to underscore the broader application of poetic analysis to pop music.</p><p data-start="1944" data-end="2425">The article is structured like a standard academic paper, complete with abstract, literature review, and methodology. I agree with its central claim that Gray‚Äôs figurative language is key to emotional storytelling. The lyrics in <em data-start="2172" data-end="2183">Superache</em> cover themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and personal loss. When combined with dominant metaphors, these themes become powerful tools for storytelling and emotional engagement, showcasing the emotional depth typically reserved for poetry.</p><p data-start="2427" data-end="3243">For example, the article analyzes Gray‚Äôs song ‚ÄúAstronomy,‚Äù describing it as a reflection on a relationship that has ‚Äúdrifted apart, with two people becoming like different worlds despite once being close‚Äù (209). While the song contains romantic undertones, like the line ‚ÄúI thought if I wandered, I‚Äôd fall back in love‚Äù (209), the authors allow for open interpretation, which I appreciate. Gray‚Äôs lyrics feel intentionally ambiguous, making the song relatable to listeners whether they‚Äôre mourning a romantic relationship, a lost friendship, or emotional distance from someone important. The metaphor comparing emotional distance to space helps listeners visualize and feel the loneliness, like being on different planets. This kind of imagery is deeply poetic and offers a compelling way to teach figurative language.</p><p data-start="3245" data-end="3846">This use of metaphor demonstrates how lyrics can go beyond surface storytelling to reflect human experience. It‚Äôs also where I think the article‚Äôs argument is strongest, connecting music to poetry instruction. However, the article only offers brief analysis for each song, including ‚ÄúAstronomy.‚Äù While it references a wide range of tracks, this approach limits the depth of analysis. I believe the article would have been more effective if it had focused more deeply on two or three songs instead of trying to include the entire album. The breadth is impressive, but it sacrifices clarity and richness.</p><p data-start="3848" data-end="4403">Despite this, Ardike and her co-authors succeed in laying out their methodology clearly. They gathered lyrics from Genius.com, listened to the songs, identified instances of figurative language, and categorized them using Leech‚Äôs framework. Their process demonstrates a strong commitment to research integrity and adds credibility to their findings. Most importantly, the article connects these findings to education, arguing that Gray‚Äôs work can be used to help students better understand how metaphor and other poetic devices bring depth to storytelling.</p><p data-start="4405" data-end="4980">The article concludes by emphasizing how Gray‚Äôs lyrics explore ‚Äúpain and longing following heartbreak while stressing the importance of moving forward and‚Ä¶ self-improvement‚Äù (213). His work across the album captures the stages of emotional growth, falling in love, struggling, breaking apart, reflecting, and letting go. Through the use of figurative language, Gray crafts a deeply emotional narrative that resonates with many listeners. The song ‚ÄúAstronomy,‚Äù in particular, captures the quiet grief of emotional distance with both lyrical restraint and metaphorical richness.</p><p data-start="4982" data-end="5454">Ultimately, <em data-start="4994" data-end="5005">Superache</em> proves that figurative language in music is more than just an artistic choice, it is a way to express complex human emotions. Gray‚Äôs lyrics, when studied closely, reveal the same emotional and structural complexity as poetry, making them valuable teaching tools. In presenting realistic, sometimes painful depictions of love and loss, Gray challenges the pop genre‚Äôs romantic clich√©s and invites listeners to reflect on their own emotional journeys.</p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html">üåï</a></p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>¬© Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1039577401&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/conan-gray" title="Conan Gray" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Conan Gray</a> ¬∑ <a href="https://soundcloud.com/conan-gray/astronomy" title="Astronomy" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Astronomy</a></div></body></html>
