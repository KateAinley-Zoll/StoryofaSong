The article claims that figurative language in a song can “evoke emotional responses from their audiences” and are “powerful communication tools” (205), which is why Gray’s songs are so impactful on a wide range of audiences allowing students to better understand poetry through modern music. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They highlight how metaphors are the most dominant figurative language used within the album and how it is the most effective in influencing the audience. The article writes about the similarities between poetry and Gray’s lyrics containing figurative devices which are normally used to “convey explicit messages and enhance aesthetic appeal” (205), much like poetry. To do this, Ardike, Nugrahani, and Hidayat use the research of Geoggry N. Leech and his book ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2014), which underscores how figurative language is sorted into eight categories of unique language. The article also uses the knowledge of different studies that analyze the figurative language of other songs such as ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birdy’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Panungkas, NIKI’s music, and Maroon 5’s albums.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This study is structured into a basic research paper layout with an abstract, introduction, literary review, and research with existing studies which all justify the study being done on Conan Gray’s lyrics. I agree with the argument of the article, showing that literary devices are one of the best ways to communicate with the audience and tell a story/share a message. The argument claims that Superache’s lyrics contain figurative language that makes them valuable to poetry and the audience's understanding of the music. With metaphors being the most used piece of language combined with the album's themes of love, heartbreak, loss, self-discovery, etc, it shows the layers of emotion that these themes can carry when experienced by an individual. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, they delve into my specific song ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astronomy’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at one point in their research. They summarize the song by stating it's about a relationship that has “drifted apart, with two people becoming like different worlds despite once being close” (209). When songs bring up relationships like this, it is most often characterized by a romantic relationship but I enjoyed that the article did not pigeonhole the idea that this song could also be about close friends as I believe Gray left this song up for interpretation of the audience. There are major hints that this song has romantic undertones such as when it states “I thought if I wandered, I’d fall back in love” (209), the article doesn't explicitly say it's about a lover which allows the interpretation to be whatever the audience sees fit. Whether it's moving away from your best friend for college, a romantic partner, or even just a crush, this song applies to all. The metaphor of comparing astronomy with a relationship allows imagery for the audience to understand Gray’s story and lyrics more. Comparing his emotions of separating to being two worlds apart shows the depth of his feelings and underscores the impact this distance has had on him. This type of metaphorical use is often used in poetry and these lyrics can be used to teach students about the importance of literary devices when bringing forth an important message. However, the article only touches on each song briefly, which provides a lack of foundation when looking at the evidence. The article presents a significant amount of evidence, however, it is surface-level in analysis and is condensed into a single paragraph for each song. The article would have presented stronger if it focused on analyzing two or three songs while briefly mentioning the others instead of trying to jam in the whole album, </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ardike, etc. succeeds in laying out the methodology of exactly how they came to their conclusion. Firstly, they collected lyrics from ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superache’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">using Genius.com. Secondly, they listened to the songs for accurate interpretations and identified every figurative language used in the songs. Additionally, they categorized the language based on Leech’s framework and analyzed their meanings and relevance to poetry teaching.  The study's relevance is related to its educational application. As it highlights the artist's lyrics, it serves as an effective teaching material for poetry and figurative language. The songs show the emotional depth of literary devices and poetic expression. The article concluded that this album explores the “pain and longing following heartbreak while stressing the importance of moving forward and… self-improvement.”  (213). Gray used the entire album to tell a story to emphasize the beginnings of love, relationship struggles, self-destruction, reflection, and letting go. Through figurative language, Gray expertly tells the story of the emotions and steps of a relationship with multiple songs and by analyzing these lyrics, students can better understand how figurative language enhances storytelling and emotion in poetry. Ultimately, ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superache’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows figurative language is not just an artistic tool but a way to express human experiences in a way that resonates.</span></p><p> </p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
