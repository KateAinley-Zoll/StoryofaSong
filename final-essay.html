The article argues that figurative language in music can “evoke emotional responses from their audiences” and are “powerful communication tools” (205), which is why Gray’s songs resonate with a wide audience. This is particularly relevant in educational settings, where students can better understand poetry through modern music. Gray’s work, especially in <em data-start="1123" data-end="1134">Superache</em>, challenges traditional pop’s presentation of love as idealized by showing how emotional drift is just as central to romantic experience.</p><p data-start="1274" data-end="1942">The authors highlight metaphors as the dominant figurative language in the album, claiming they are the most effective in influencing audiences. They emphasize the similarity between poetry and Gray’s lyrics, noting that both use figurative devices to “convey explicit messages and enhance aesthetic appeal” (205). To support this claim, Ardike, Nugrahani, and Hidayat reference Geoffrey N. Leech’s <em data-start="1673" data-end="1711">A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry</em> (2014), which categorizes eight types of figurative language. They also compare Gray’s use of metaphor with other artists such as Panungkas, NIKI, and Maroon 5 to underscore the broader application of poetic analysis to pop music.</p><p data-start="1944" data-end="2425">The article is structured like a standard academic paper, complete with abstract, literature review, and methodology. I agree with its central claim that Gray’s figurative language is key to emotional storytelling. The lyrics in <em data-start="2172" data-end="2183">Superache</em> cover themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and personal loss. When combined with dominant metaphors, these themes become powerful tools for storytelling and emotional engagement, showcasing the emotional depth typically reserved for poetry.</p><p data-start="2427" data-end="3243">For example, the article analyzes Gray’s song “Astronomy,” describing it as a reflection on a relationship that has “drifted apart, with two people becoming like different worlds despite once being close” (209). While the song contains romantic undertones, like the line “I thought if I wandered, I’d fall back in love” (209), the authors allow for open interpretation, which I appreciate. Gray’s lyrics feel intentionally ambiguous, making the song relatable to listeners whether they’re mourning a romantic relationship, a lost friendship, or emotional distance from someone important. The metaphor comparing emotional distance to space helps listeners visualize and feel the loneliness, like being on different planets. This kind of imagery is deeply poetic and offers a compelling way to teach figurative language.</p><p data-start="3245" data-end="3846">This use of metaphor demonstrates how lyrics can go beyond surface storytelling to reflect human experience. It’s also where I think the article’s argument is strongest, connecting music to poetry instruction. However, the article only offers brief analysis for each song, including “Astronomy.” While it references a wide range of tracks, this approach limits the depth of analysis. I believe the article would have been more effective if it had focused more deeply on two or three songs instead of trying to include the entire album. The breadth is impressive, but it sacrifices clarity and richness.</p><p data-start="3848" data-end="4403">Despite this, Ardike and her co-authors succeed in laying out their methodology clearly. They gathered lyrics from Genius.com, listened to the songs, identified instances of figurative language, and categorized them using Leech’s framework. Their process demonstrates a strong commitment to research integrity and adds credibility to their findings. Most importantly, the article connects these findings to education, arguing that Gray’s work can be used to help students better understand how metaphor and other poetic devices bring depth to storytelling.</p><p data-start="4405" data-end="4980">The article concludes by emphasizing how Gray’s lyrics explore “pain and longing following heartbreak while stressing the importance of moving forward and… self-improvement” (213). His work across the album captures the stages of emotional growth, falling in love, struggling, breaking apart, reflecting, and letting go. Through the use of figurative language, Gray crafts a deeply emotional narrative that resonates with many listeners. The song “Astronomy,” in particular, captures the quiet grief of emotional distance with both lyrical restraint and metaphorical richness.</p><p data-start="4982" data-end="5454">Ultimately, <em data-start="4994" data-end="5005">Superache</em> proves that figurative language in music is more than just an artistic choice, it is a way to express complex human emotions. Gray’s lyrics, when studied closely, reveal the same emotional and structural complexity as poetry, making them valuable teaching tools. In presenting realistic, sometimes painful depictions of love and loss, Gray challenges the pop genre’s romantic clichés and invites listeners to reflect on their own emotional journeys.</p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html">🌕</a></p><p><br><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/crit-reading-assignemnt.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/final-essay.html" class="al" target="_self">Metaphors</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/music-review.html" class="al" target="_self">Music Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/playlist-nad-listening-guide.html" class="al" target="_self">Playlist</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/introduction.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/bibliography.html" class="al" target="_self">Exploding Star</a></li><li><a href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kateainley-zoll.github.io/StoryofaSong/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
